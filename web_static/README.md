## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to replicate the Airbnb user interface using static web pages. The focus is on understanding and implementing the basic structure of web pages using HTML and styling them with CSS. While this is just the beginning, it sets the foundation for future stages where we'll introduce dynamic features and interactivity.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azukauteh/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 0x01-airbnb-clone-web-static
   ```

## Usage

To view the static pages, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can explore different sections of the Airbnb interface, such as the homepage, search results, property listings, and more. This project primarily focuses on the visual aspect, and no real functionality or dynamic features are implemented at this stage.

## Features

- **Homepage:** Replicates the Airbnb homepage with a hero section and a featured destinations grid.
- **Search Results:** Displays search results for properties with a grid layout, showcasing property images and basic information.
- **Property Listing:** Provides detailed information about a specific property, including images, description, and amenities.

Please note that these features are static and serve as a foundation for further development.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Markup for structuring web pages.
- CSS: Styling and layout of web pages.
